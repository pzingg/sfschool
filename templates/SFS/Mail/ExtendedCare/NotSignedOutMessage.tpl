Dear {$parent_1_Name}{if $parent_2_Name} and {$parent_2_Name}{/if}:

We noticed that you did not sign out your child {$childName} from Extended Day on the signout system on the following days:

{$days}

You are charged for the entire time, i.e. 2 activity blocks if you do not sign your child out.  Signing your child out also helps us keep track of who is in school in case of an emergency.

If you have any questions about Extended Care, please contact {$extendedCareCoordinatorName} at {$extendedCareCoordinatorEmail}

Thank you
